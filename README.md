This is a timer with a focus on productivity, based on the pomodoro technique and tweaked for a different user experience.

Technologies used:
- HTML/CSS
- SASS
- Javascript
- React

The main objective of this timer is maximizing focus. When a person uses the pomodoro technique, oftentimes it's necessary to take pause the timer before it ends, either because of something necessary or just a distraction. The timer takes this into consideration and allows to pause but, any wasted time is added to the timer; this allows to stop the time in case anything important comes up while discouraging from any unnecessary distractions.

The timer also uses colors to indicate state, a dark background means it's time to focus, while the white background indicates a moment to relax.

This app was written with react, and sass for the styles. The current time and phase of the timer (focus/relax) is saved in the state. Also, I used an API to fetch random motivational phrases. The website uses notifications when the timer ends and is fully responsive.
